# Bundle Recorder

A plugin for [Jenkins][]. It adds a publisher that, when enabled,
keeps track of your ruby library or application's gem dependencies at
the point of build. It provides views of this information, including
listing changes between adjacent builds.

[Jenkins]: http://jenkinsci.org/

## In development

Please note that this plugin is still in development and has not yet
been published to the Jenkins Update Center.
